                            Maid Finder makes every effort through contractual means and through the use of email
                            addresses and passwords to restrict those who have access to our service from using Profiles
                            and Résumés other than for the purpose of fulfilling a job posting. However, Maid Finder
                            cannot guarantee that all employers, recruiters and other persons with access will adhere to
                            the limitations that we impose on them, or that unauthorized persons will not gain access to
                            the database. If at any time you would like your Profile removed from our site, you may do
                            so by navigating to the “Account Information” section of the site, while being logged in.
                            This will also remove your Résumé. If at any time you would simply like your Résumé removed
                            from our site, you may do so by navigating to the “Edit Profiles” section of the site.
                            However, Families or Job Seekers and others who have subscribed for access to the service,
                            or for whose job posting you may have applied, may already have retained a copy of your
                            Profile and Résumé in their own systems and databases.
