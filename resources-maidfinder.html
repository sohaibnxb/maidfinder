              <p class="aboutus-paras">The full time live-in maid option is the most common in Dubai.
                Having said that full-time live-out options do exist yet with special conditions. You
                could find a housemaid who lives with her husband or family and accepts to work
                full-time at your home; however, keep in mind as an employer you need to secure for the
                housemaid a legal sponsorship and take on her responsibility even if she lives out.
                Moreover, a transport arrangement should be agreed upon between the employer and the
                housemaid. A more trusted and hassle-free option is to hire a full-time live-out from a
                maid agency. Elite Maids Full-time maids offer fully vetted full-time maids; with a
                charge starting 3,500 AED for livein. That price includes a visa, medical test, air
                ticket, and medical insurance.</p>

                Centers</h3>
              <p class="aboutus-paras">Decide whether you want to find a housemaid</p>
              <p class="aboutus-paras">Through one of Tadbeer’s service centers or hire direct from an
                existing pool of experienced maids residing in the UAE. Hiring through a service center
                is immediate, as it requires that you visit a center in person and select a candidate
                then and there; hence this approach takes out the hassle of the search and selection.
                However, such centers will offer you a limited pool of available housemaids and will
                charge higher monthly and annual fees, as they account for a finder’s fee that starts
                with 8,000 AED upfront or 35,000 AED is cumulative over 2 years.</p>
              <p class="aboutus-paras">Many households, who are not in a rush to hire, and can spare 1-3
                weeks to search and select a maid, prefer to take matters into their own hands and hire
                a helper direct. At Maid Finder Dubai our wide online database gives you access to
                hundreds of maid cv’s and their contact details. The best way to find a maid with zero
                agency fees is through our online portal; our database access fee starts from 350 AED.
                Start your search early and give yourself plenty of time to find someone suitable for
                your needs. Based on our client reviews the process of selection and hiring takes from
                1-3 weeks, and more than 95% of our users end up finding a suitable housemaid, success
                is highly dependent on how attractive is your offer to the maid. Over the years
                Maidfinder has developed recurring household users who depend on our database as a
                platform to hire their next housemaid.</p>
