                        Although we do take all measures to select the right maid or nanny and post her in our website,
                        the maid may turn out to be a bad fit for your family. In the interview, you will be able to
                        assess the nanny’s working skills, communication skills, and motivation. The following are tips
                        that we strongly recommend that you read carefully.

                            <strong>Shortlist several candidates;</strong> screen and interview a minimum of 3-5
                            candidates so you have a
                            basis for comparison and do not make rushed decisions. Moreover, good candidates get hired
                            fast so make sure you select several candidates to avoid disappointment.

                    <h3 class="interview-heading">2. Interview Scheduling Tips</h3>

                    <div class="mb-80">
                        <p>
                            Contact maids and wait for replies; use both phone and Whatsapp when reaching out, and allow
                            time for maids to reply to your inquiries.
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>Pick a location and time that suits the candidateto avoid cancellation;</strong>
                            consider the maid’s time constraints, especially that they might
                            still be working and finishing their contract. Hence, most may only be available to meet for
                            an interview on weekends. Also, consider the distance of the meeting location, how close is
                            it to a metro and any transportation costs she would incur. We recommend that you cover this
                            cost if possible, as many agree to the meeting to satisfy potential employer but might
                            cancel last minute if time and location are challenging.
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>Interview personally shortlisted candidates;</strong> interviews can happen
                            face-to-face or via a video call. This process is
                            difficult to outsource as it all depends on your click with the candidate and intuition.
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>Choose a quiet location;</strong> a place where you feel comfortable so you can
                            fully concentrate on
                            the interview. If you decide to meet a candidate in public, do it in a quiet place where you
                            will not be disturbed. If you interview via phone or video call, make sure you have a good
                            connection and will not be disturbed by your boss or crying children.
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>
                                Introduce your child
                                and other family members to the candidate;
                            </strong> examine how well they interact.
                            <br><br>
                            Allow ample time
                            for each interview; it may be tempting to meet as many candidates as possible in one day,
                            but make sure you allow sufficient time for each one so you get to know the candidate as
                            well as possible. Being rushed could mean overlooking some important personality traits.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <strong>Prepare a summary of what you expect from the role;</strong> in terms of duties,
                            working hours, days
                            off, and the package you are offering. You can also use this summary to introduce your
                            ethical and personal expectations to the candidates. Give all these aspects thought in
                            advance and prepare a concise summary to share with the candidates in the interview.
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>

                                a concise list of questions;
                            </strong> it may be tempting to ask as many questions as possible, but
                            the answers may overwhelm you, which will make it difficult to remember all the details.
                            Make your own checklist, with a couple of important pointers with targeted clear questions.
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>Tailor your questions to what is most relevant to you;</strong>  for example,
                            whether they have
                            experience with babies if your child is very young, or whether they are comfortable with
                            pets if you have a dog.
                            <br><br>
                            <strong> Print out the question checklist in advance;</strong> this
                            will help you
                            recall the important details of your interview.
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>Show your best side;</strong>
                             remember Interviews
                            are mutual the candidate has to also decide whether she would like to work for you. Do not
                            forget to smile but also act professionally.

                            <strong>Make a prompt decision;</strong>  as employers may snatch up the best helpers

                            on a paid trial where you can start to show them the ropes, and see how you get
                            along.
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>

                    <h3 class="interview-heading">What Is The Difference Between Nanny And Maid?</h3>

                    <p class="mb-40">
                        When deciding who you are looking to employ, think about the tasks they will be undertaking – or
                        not, such as:
                    </p>

                    <ul class="interview-ul mb-40">
                        <li>
                            It is a perfect answer to the challenge of how to allow your child to maintain the routine
                            within the home environment rather than opting-in for day care centre.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Laundry for the
                            family or only the children
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Cooking meals for the children – or all the family
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Managing
                            household administration
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="mb-80">
                        Whilst there will be some crossover between some of the tasks, there are some areas which are
                        purely associated with being a nanny and some with a maid and knowing the scope of each role
                        will help you decide who you realy like.
                    </p>



                    <h3 class="interview-heading">Being A Maid</h3>
                    <div class="mb-80">

                        <p>
                            A maid is a central part of the home. They manage many areas such as cleaning, laundry,
                            cooking,
                            shopping and can often be asked to undertake administrative responsibilities such as
                            financial
                            record-keeping.
                            <br><br>
                            A maid is a central part of the home. They manage many areas such as
                            cleaning,
                            laundry, cooking, shopping and can often be asked to undertake administrative
                            responsibilities
                            such as financial record-keeping.
                            <br><br>
                            Cleaning will be a pivotal responsibility for any maid but
                            they will also have the task of ensuring that there is food available for meals  on and that
                            errands are carried out. In a large household, the maid may have cleaning staff they manage
                            who
                            will carry out the deeper cleaning jobs or have certain areas of the home they clean each
                            day.
                            <br><br>
                            A maid will certainly have interaction with any children in the household but they won’t be
                            expected to care for them; this is the job of the nanny.
                            <br><br>
                            Maids will either have professional
                            qualifications or a raft of experience. Some will have specialist skills such as being a
                            professional cook.
                            <br><br>
                            Luckily in UAE in General and Dubai, most maids have nanny experience,
                            theirfore they can be a maid and nanny in the same time. However in such case you need to
                            balance the tasks, for example do not expect the maid and nanny to take care of more than 2
                            children and do the complete household chores perfectly. Some moms are a stay home mom who
                            can take care of the children if the maid is busy finishing her housechores.
