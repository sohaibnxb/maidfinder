                            Each maid profile is checked thoroughly before being uploaded on to our website. All listed maids currently reside in the UAE; we meet and interview each maid when developing her profiles. Maids are invited for face-to-face interviews at our offices, during which, our experienced recruitment consultants verify visa and employment papers, validate skills and personal information, and lastly check references for each single maid.

                            Each maid profile is checked thoroughly before being uploaded on to our website. All listed maids currently reside in the UAE; we meet and interview each maid when developing her profiles. Maids are invited for face-to-face interviews at our offices, during which, our experienced recruitment consultants verify visa and employment papers, validate skills and personal information, and lastly check references for each single maid.
